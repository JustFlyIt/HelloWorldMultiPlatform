# HelloWorldMultiPlatform
Contains HelloWorld C code and related configuration files for multi-platform builds via command line or Eclipse.

The purpose for this demostration is to:

* Show how to manage development operations via the Eclipse IDE
* Show how to manage development operations via the command line
* Demonstrate how to cross compile for multiple platforms including: x86-64, ARM and RISCV.  A Raspberry Pi platform option is coming

One of iSpace's key tenents is not to require specific development tools but to give software engineers the opportunity to choose for themselves inorder to maximize productivity and development satisfaction.  Use of Eclipse is not required.  

Currently, iSpace ARM development is being done via the command line, supported by the text editor Atom.  Atom is extremely useful as a text editor and code manager with a clean and concise Git interface.  But as with Eclipse, Atom is not required.
